# ECHILD Tutorial template repo - R flavour

This repo is a template for creating ECHILD tutorials primarily focusing on an 
implementation using the R programming language.

The template, hopefully, easily enables tutorial creators to make use of 
isolated development environments, locally or cloud hosted.
